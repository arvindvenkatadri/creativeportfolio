## Introduction

Hello. I am Nidhee Deshak, an oddball who freaks out if my code isn't running XD. Below are the works that according to me are my best and for which I've put in my maximum efforts. 

## Graph 1

I created a dataset where I chose the famous TV show "Friends". I chose the six main characters and looked at their sex, relationship status, birthyear and zodiac signs. I think these chosen variables are quite accurate to define and portray the characters. 

I entered this information in an excel sheet and exported it as a **"csv"** file. 

I also created a sub data set where the **centrality deagree** and **betweenness** are introduced. Centrality degree measures the number of edges connected to a node and betweenness shows us how much a node is playing a part in connecting a pair of other nodes. 

```{r read-1}
frnds_nodes <- read_csv("frnds_nodes.csv")
frnds_nodes
frnds_edges <- read.csv("frnds_edges.csv")
frnds_edges 
```


```{r}

ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = frnds_nodes, 
                edges = frnds_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ga
```


```{r}
ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Incoming connections
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = c("in"))) %>% 
  filter(degree > 0) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  # connectivity
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness())
```


As mentioned above, the graph below represents the ***centrality degree*** and ***betweenness*** of the nodes. 



```{r plot-1}


ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Max connections
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  
  # Bich ka bandar
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>%
  
  # Now graphs
  ggraph(.,layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, colour = degree)) + 
  
 
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend",
                       low = "green",
                       high = "red")
              

```


As we can see, Monica has the maximum betweenness. This tells us that she is the connecting entity between almost every other individual. She is probably the mutual friend everyone had before getting introduced. 

We can say that she is the hub which holds everything quite together. Ross, though he has a lot of incoming edges, they are merely introductory connections and he's not really close to a lot of people.

The thickness of the edges represent the **betweenness** among every node. Thicker the edge, more is their betweenness. The color gradation and size of the nodes show us the **degree of centrality** which corresponds to number of edges incoming or emerging from a node i.e. the degree of interaction one character has with others.  


## Graph 2

The given dataset is derived from the **"osmdata"**. I wanted to plot the map of my birthplace i.e. Nagpur. I specifically chose the are of "Shivaji Nagar" and created sub datasets like highways, parks, buildings and landuse that are present in Shivaji Nagar. 

I further divided these and found how many buildings are schools, hospitals, place of worhsip or how many highways are primary type. 

```{r read-2}
bbox1 <- prettymapr::searchbbox("Shivaji Nagar, Nagpur, India")
bbox1
dat_b <- extract_osm_objects(key = "building", bbox = bbox1)
dat_h <- extract_osm_objects(key = "highway", bbox = bbox1)
dat_p <- extract_osm_objects(key = "park", bbox = bbox1)
dat_g <- extract_osm_objects(key = "landuse", value = "grass", bbox = bbox1)
dat_b
dat_h
dat_p
dat_g
dat_sch <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox1, key = "amenity", value = "school", return_type = "point")
dat_w <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox1, key = "amenity", value = "place_of_worship", return_type = "point")
dat_r <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox1, key = "highway", value = "primary", return_type = "line")
dat_c <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox1, key = "amenity", value = "hospital", return_type = "point")
dat_sch
dat_w
dat_r
dat_c
```

I plotted a map of Shivaji Nagar, Nagpur, India. 
The green patches are the parks present in that area. 
The red lines are the highway roads.
The yellow dots are the hospitals.
The white line is the only primary highway present in that area. 
The blue dots are the different places of worship. 

The map making was quite an interesting process as it had its own systematic approach which gave a clearer idea of how documentation and mapping takes place. 

```{r plot-2}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = dat_p, fill = "green") + 
  geom_sf(data = dat_sch, colour = "black") + 
  geom_sf(data = dat_h, color = "red" ) + 
  geom_sf(data = dat_c, color = "blue", fill = "yellow", shape = 21, size = 4) + geom_sf(data = dat_r, color = "white") + 
  geom_sf(data = dat_w, color = "black", fill = "blue", shape = 21, size = 4) + theme(legend.position = "right") + 
  labs(title = "All about the Orange city", caption = "based on osmdata")


```

## Graph 3

I chose the dataset "msleep" which shows the sleep cycles and schedules of different animals. 

The table also tells us about the nature of those animals like genus, the type of vore, their orders and conservation.

```{r read-3}
msleep
```

Th graph below shows the density of the sleep rem among different types of vore like herbivores, carnivores, etc. 

The aes() function helps us in visual differentiation as it assigns different colors by default. 

```{r plot-3}
ggplot(msleep) + geom_density( aes(x = sleep_rem,
                                   color = vore,
                                   fill = vore),
                               alpha = 0.5)

```

## My Course Reflection

This course was about learning the basics of R language and how we can plot different maps and graphs using that language. At first I was quite intimidated as I had never coded before. But under Arvind's guidance I was able to understand the most difficult of concepts pretty easily. 

I found some of the metaphorical connections in the language very interesting. One of them was the 'nodes' and 'edges' which refer to hubs or cluster and interactions or dependency respectively. I realized that the map making and graph plotting really helps us understand the information in a better manner. 

Thus, I am sure that I'll be applying these new learnt concepts in future to make people understand my thoughts in a better and visual manner. I feel that these methods also paves a new road to visually represent and document subjective and qualitative information, which I didn't imagine was possible. 

I have become fond of the satisfactory feeling I get after the file is knitted and I have a presentable html. 

I would like to work more on improving these concepts and think of ways in which I can use them to compliment my projects. 

Thank you :)
