## Introduction

> HI!! I'm Aditi and you're going to see a few of my favorite graphs and maps that I made using R Studio.

## Graph 1


```{r}
ggplot(penguins) + geom_bar(aes(x = species, fill = sex),position = "stack")
ggplot(penguins) + geom_bar(aes(x = island, fill = sex),position = "stack")
```
 


## Graph 2





```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, color = color, alpha = 0.3))+
geom_bar()
```











## Graph 3



```{r read-3}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, y = color, fill = color, color = color, alpha = 0.3))+
geom_point(size = 0.01)
```



## My Course Reflection

This course was very insightful, i hope to use rstudio much more in the future, arvind was also an angel of a teacher, i hope we can meet again in the future :)
