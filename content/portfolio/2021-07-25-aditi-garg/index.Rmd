## Introduction

> HI!! I'm Aditi and you're going to see a few of my favorite graphs and maps that I made using R Studio.

## Graph 1: 

How are these **Brooklyn99** characters related to each other?

```{r}
B99_nodes <- read.csv("./data/B99 nodes.csv" )
B99_edges <- read.csv("./data/B99 edges.csv" )
B99_edges
B99_nodes
``` 

```{r}
library(visNetwork)


B99_edges
B99_nodes

B99_nodes_vis <- B99_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("label" = name) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "M" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  rename("group" = sex)
B99_nodes_vis
B99_edges_vis <- B99_edges %>% 
  select(from, to) %>% 
  left_join(., B99_nodes_vis, by = c("from" = "label")) %>% 
  left_join(., B99_nodes_vis, by = c("to" = "label")) %>%
  select("from"= id.x, "to" = id.y)
B99_edges_vis





#seperation
B99_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = B99_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 20)) %>% 
  
  # Colour and icons for each of the gender-groups
  visGroups(groupname = "Female", shape = "circle", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 20, color = "violet"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Male", shape = "circle", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 20, color = "skyblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  

  
  #visLegend() %>%
  #Add the fontawesome icons!!
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  
  # Add Interaction Controls
  visInteraction(selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```
It shows how each character is connected to the other,i.e shows the relationships between them.

I used circle as an icon for each character and the females are represented by voilet and males are represented by sky blue color.

## Graph 2
How many diamonds are very good?
I chose the DIAMONDS dataset for this graph.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, color = color, alpha = 0.3))+
geom_bar()
```

I plotted a graph of the count vs the cut to find how many diamonds are of very good cut.



## Graph 3
My map of Mysore

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#bbox_p <- prettymapr::searchbbox(querystring = "Mysore,India")
bbox_p<- osmdata::getbb("Mysore")
bbox_p
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#DOWNLOADING DATA FROM OPEN STREET MAP AND ASSIGNING TO VARIABLES

dat_B <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'building', bbox = bbox_p)
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'highway', bbox = bbox_p)
dat_P <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'park', bbox = bbox_p)
dat_G <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'landuse', value = 'grass', bbox = bbox_p)
dat_T <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'natural', value = 'tree', bbox = bbox_p)

glimpse(dat_H)
glimpse(dat_P)
glimpse(dat_G)
glimpse(dat_T)
glimpse(dat_B)

```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# USING GGPLOT TO MAP DATA

mysore_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dat_B, col= "gray")+
  geom_sf(data = dat_H, col = "blue") +     # LINES
  #geom_sf(data = dat_G, col = "darkseagreen1") + 
  #geom_sf(data = dat_P, col = "darkseagreen") +
  geom_sf(data = dat_T, col = "green")  +      # POINTS
  geom_sf(data = dat_R, colour = "red", size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  #geom_sf(data = dat_Healthcare, colour = "violet", size = 7, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "MYSORE")
  mysore_map
   
```


I've plotted the highways, parks, landuse and natural spots on the map of mysore.

## My Course Reflection

This course was about learning to use R programing as a design tool.
I learnt a way too many things and it was overwhelming at first until i realised its still beginner level information. I learnt to use R markdown to create a html document, learnt to make and plot graphs and maps of cities to show data, i learnt to make presentation using R.
I think all this will help my practice as an aspiring artist and designer for making presentations, for making visuals to represent data, it will help for organising research data. 
Arvind is genuinely the best teacher i've ever had and if i had to learn R in my school in the 10th or 12th grade i would've simply been overwhelmed and avoided the topic but Arvind managed to build interest and enthusiasm in me to learn and troubleshoot the errors as well. Also I want to add that Arvind has great taste in music and i'd love to have access to his playlists.
Arvind is a Boomer from Srishti who knows to use "Bruh" now.
I wish to have on campus classes with Arvind sometime:)


Jai Hind.
