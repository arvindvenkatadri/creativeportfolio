> Aren't we all just rows in a larger dataset?

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)

```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data<-readxl::read_xlsx("./data/data.xlsx")
concisedData<-data %>% select(Name, Age, Nationality, Overall,Potential, Club, Value, Wage, Position, `Preferred Foot`, `Body Type`, `Skill Moves`,BallControl, SprintSpeed, GKHandling,`International Reputation`, GKReflexes)

## Graph 1: 

### Concised FIFA dataset

The following is a datset of all the players in the game FIFA-19 and their player attributes. The initial dataset was very large, this is a concised version of the same.

```{r}
concisedData 
# %>%  
#   kbl(., caption = "FIFA dataset") %>%
#   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
#                 full_width = T) %>% scroll_box(height = "500px")
```


### What is the value of most internaltionally reputed players and which nationality and club do they belong to?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
concisedData %>% 
  filter(`International Reputation`=="5") %>% ggplot(aes(x=`International Reputation`,fill=Value)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(Nationality~Club)
```

## Graph 2: Making a map with some nice places to eat in Rajajinagar

### Interactive dark mode

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

blr_raj_restuarant <- blr_raj_restuarant %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    lat = sf::st_coordinates(blr_raj_restuarant$geometry)[, 1],
    lon = sf::st_coordinates(blr_raj_restuarant$geometry)[, 2]
  )

map <- tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(blr_raj_buildings) + tm_fill(col = "#3d3d3d", interactive = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(blr_raj_roads) + tm_lines(col = "darkgreen") + tm_shape(blr_raj_restuarant) +
  tm_graticules() + tm_symbols(
    col = "name",
    alpha = 1,
    border.lwd = 2,
    interactive = TRUE,
    popup.format = "name"
  ) + tm_layout(bg.color = "white", legend.outside = TRUE, ) + tm_compass() +
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") +
  tm_view(symbol.size.fixed = TRUE,
          set.zoom.limits = c(16, 20)) +
  tmap_options(basemaps = (Canvas = "CartoDB.DarkMatter"))

```

## Graph 3: The successors of the Michigan lake house

The following is a manually curated dataset of the characters in Bojack horseman, season 4, episode 10,11. I created a visual network for the same. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

bojack_nodes_vis <- bojack_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("name" = name) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "M" ~ "Male"))

bojack_edges_vis <- bojack_edges %>% 
  select(from, to) %>% 
  left_join(., bojack_nodes_vis, by = c("from" = "name")) %>% 
  left_join(., bojack_nodes_vis, by = c("to" = "name")) %>%
  select("from"= id.x, "to" = id.y)

bojack_nodes_vis 
# %>% kable()
#   # kbl(., caption = "Bojack nodes") %>%
#   # kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
#   #               full_width = T) %>% scroll_box(height = "500px")
  
bojack_edges_vis 
#%>% kable()
# kbl(., caption = "Bojack edges") %>%
#   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
#                 full_width = T) %>% scroll_box(width = "300px" ,height = "500px")
```

### Visual network based on species

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
b3v<-bojack_nodes_vis %>% 

  dplyr::rename("label"=name) %>%
  dplyr::rename("group"=species)
b3v

b3v %>% 
  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = bojack_edges_vis) %>%  
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Human", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 75, color = "red"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>%
  visGroups(groupname = "Horse", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f111", size = 75, color = "slateblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Swan", shape="icon",
            icon = list(code= "f056", size=70, color= "#4e0000" ),
            shadow = list(enabled = FALSE)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Goat", shape="icon",
            icon = list(code= "f056", size=50, color= "#9d0000" ),
            shadow = list(enabled = FALSE)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Dragonfly", shape="icon",
            icon = list(code= "f056", size=30, color= "#ff6262" ),
            shadow = list(enabled = FALSE)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Cat", shape="icon",
            icon = list(code= "f056", size=20, color= "#ff9d9d" ),
            shadow = list(enabled = FALSE)) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "Dog", shape="icon",
            icon = list(code= "f056", size=55, color= "#b14e4e" ),
            shadow = list(enabled = FALSE)) %>% 
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  visLegend() %>%
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```


## Reflection

Coding is something I have always enjoyed doing. Similarly this course was enjoyable as well. The course constantly kept me challenged and on my feet at all times. It was nice to spend a lot of waking and sometimes even sleeping hours trying to figure out why something is not working. It was nice to relive that feeling of finally figuring out a faulty code (it's usually the bracket)). Over all this course was good wrap to the year and was a fun introduction to R. R studio is a very powerful tool which I am sure I will explore a lot more in the years to come. I want to thank Arvind for introducing me to R. He was really patient with all my doubts and kept our enthusiasm high all through. He's the coolest boomer I know which is kinda sus..
