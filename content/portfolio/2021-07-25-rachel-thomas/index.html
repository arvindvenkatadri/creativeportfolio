<h3><strong>Graphs explored during the course of this worshop</strong></h3>
<div id="graph--1" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>GRAPH- 1</strong></h4>
<p>Using the diamonds data set to analyse data and create graphs showing the colour and depth of the diamonds. I used a colour palette for this graph as well using ggplot and geom_bar</p>

<div id="graph--2" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>GRAPH- 2</strong></h4>
<p>Using the penguins data set to analyse data and create graphs showing the island, species and sex of the penguins.
I have made a code for these graphs- geom_bar with fill</p>

<div id="graph--3" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>GRAPH- 3</strong></h4>
<p>Using the diamonds data set to analyse data and create graphs showing the depth, colour and carat of the diamonds. I used a colour palette for this graph using ggplot and geom_point.</p>

<h3><strong>REFLECTION</strong></h3>
<p>This workshop has been a very new and enriching experience for me. Learning a new language and seeing the various outputs using different data sets was interesting. I did find some parts of the workshop a bit challenging but figuring out a way to come around those problems to get to the end result was satisfying.</p>
<p>Personally, my favourite part of the studio was having to hear Arvind’s music playing in the background which definitely made for a good kick start in the morning. The studio was very well curated for one’s understanding. Realizing the various possibilities and outcomes by using just code was fascinating.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges I came across in this studio, I did find this experience new and interesting so I would love to explore creative coding in the future and this workshop was a great way of instilling that curiosity in me.</p>
