<p>Swagat Paul<br />
Following are some of the graphs I created and explored different qualities of during a coding workshop.</p>

<p>These graphs reflected on the sleeping and waking patterns of different kinds of animals. I found this dataset interesting as a whole and it was fun to play around with the different attributes.</p>

<h2>My Course Reflection</h2>
<p>This course was about exploring and visualing data and it’s different forms, using code.</p>
<p>What I learnt - I learnt how to be patient and not get frustated every 30 seconds when a chunk of code didn’t work. I can’t say I was very successful but there were several attempts made. I also learnt that coding and myself might not be a good fit, but much like a dysfunctional relationship, I scraped by and held on till the end.</p>
<p>How it will help my practice as an aspiring artist and designer - I do think it helped me see data analysis in a new light and how it could be used to form interesting visuals.</p>
<p>Arvind is a wonderful teacher and person, possibly one of the coolest teachers I’ve met. And he likes cats! His personality and humour were the reason I could bear the fearful being that is coding. I would love to know him in real life and attend more of his classes, provided they aren’t remotely related to code. Perhaps order and chaos would be a better fit for me.</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
