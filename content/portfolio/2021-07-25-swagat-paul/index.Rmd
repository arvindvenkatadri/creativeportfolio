## Introduction

> Swagat Paul  
Following are some of the graphs I created and explored different qualities of during a coding workshop.

## The Graphs
#### My first two graphs are from T5 and were based on the msleep dataset which contained information on various animals

```{r Look at msleep}
names(msleep) # Column, i.e. Variable names
head(msleep) # first six rows
tail(msleep) # Last six rows
dim(msleep) # Size of dataset
```
## Graph 1
```{r graph 1}
msleep %>% 
  slice_sample(prop = 0.5) %>% 
  ggplot(.) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = sleep_total, y = awake,
                   fill = vore)) +
  labs(title = "1. Box Plot")
```

## Graph 2

```{r graph 2}
ggplot(msleep,
           aes(x = vore,
               fill = order)) + 
  geom_bar(position ="dodge") +
  ggtitle(label =
            "2. A dodged bar chart")

```

## Graph 3

```{r graph 5}
ggplot(msleep) +
  aes(x = awake,
      y = sleep_total, color = vore) +  
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~vore) +
  ggtitle("5. A point geom graph with facets")

```


These graphs reflected on the sleeping and waking patterns of different kinds of animals. I found this dataset interesting as a whole and it was fun to play around with the different attributes.  

## My Course Reflection

This course was about exploring and visualing data and it's different forms, using code.

What I learnt - I learnt how to be patient and not get frustated every 30 seconds when a chunk of code didn't work. I can't say I was very successful but there were several attempts made. I also learnt that coding and myself might not be a good fit, but much like a dysfunctional relationship, I scraped by and held on till the end.

How it will help my practice as an aspiring artist and designer - I do think it helped me see data analysis in a new light and how it could be used to form interesting visuals.

Arvind is a wonderful teacher and person, possibly one of the coolest teachers I've met. And he likes cats! His personality and humour were the reason I could bear the fearful being that is coding. I would love to know him in real life and attend more of his classes, provided they aren't remotely related to code. Perhaps order and chaos would be a better fit for me.


thank you.
