## Introduction

> Swagat Paul  
Following are some of the graphs I created and explored different qualities of during a coding workshop.

## The Graphs
#### My first two graphs are from T5 and were based on the msleep dataset which contained information on various animals


```
##  [1] "name"         "genus"        "vore"         "order"        "conservation"
##  [6] "sleep_total"  "sleep_rem"    "sleep_cycle"  "awake"        "brainwt"     
## [11] "bodywt"
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 11

These graphs reflected on the sleeping and waking patterns of different kinds of animals. I found this dataset interesting as a whole and it was fun to play around with the different attributes.  

## My Course Reflection

This course was about exploring and visualing data and it's different forms, using code.

What I learnt - I learnt how to be patient and not get frustated every 30 seconds when a chunk of code didn't work. I can't say I was very successful but there were several attempts made. I also learnt that coding and myself might not be a good fit, but much like a dysfunctional relationship, I scraped by and held on till the end.

How it will help my practice as an aspiring artist and designer - I do think it helped me see data analysis in a new light and how it could be used to form interesting visuals.

Arvind is a wonderful teacher and person, possibly one of the coolest teachers I've met. And he likes cats! His personality and humour were the reason I could bear the fearful being that is coding. I would love to know him in real life and attend more of his classes, provided they aren't remotely related to code. Perhaps order and chaos would be a better fit for me.


thank you.
