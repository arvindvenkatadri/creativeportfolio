```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(osmplotr)
library(tmap)
library(RColorBrewer)

```


## Graph No 1.

In this graph, we've explored a total of three variables, i.e., clarity, cut and the price of the diamonds dataset.  Using the RColorBrewer package, colours have also been added.  _Via LAB04_  


```{r }

ggplot(diamonds) + geom_point(aes(x = clarity, y = price, color = cut), size = 3) + scale_colour_viridis_d(option = "inferno") + labs(title = "Viridis Palette", subtitle = "Option Inferno") + facet_wrap(~cut)

```


## Graph No 2.

Adding the longitude and latitude of Delhi to create maps of my surrounding areas

```{r Another Setup}

bbox <- osmplotr::get_bbox(c(77.10,28.66,77.17,28.70))

bbox_l <- osmdata::getbb("Delhi, India") 
#bbox_p <- prettymapr::searchbbox("Delhi, India") 

```

```{r}

dat_B <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'building', bbox = bbox) 
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'highway', bbox = bbox)
dat_P <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'park', bbox = bbox)
dat_G <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'landuse', value = 'grass', bbox = bbox)
dat_T <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'natural', value = 'tree', bbox = bbox,return_type = "point")
dat_R <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox, key = "amenity", value = "restaurant", return_type = "point") 

```

```{r}

tmap_mode("plot")

```



**Graph No2.**  
Using the data from around my lacation, plotting graphs of various features.  _Via LAB06_  

```{r}

#1
tm_shape(dat_B) + tm_bubbles(col = "red") +
  
#2
  tm_shape(dat_H) + tm_lines(col = "black", lwd = 1) +

#3
  tm_shape(dat_R) + tm_dots(size = 3, col = "yellow", shape = 21) + tm_text("name", auto.placement = TRUE) + 
  tm_compass(type = "rose", position = c("right", "top")) + tm_scale_bar(width = 1, position = c("right", "bottom")) + 
   labs(title = "It's a bloody red city")
  
```


## Graph No 3.

#### *SETUP-Reading data

```{r 1.Read-greys-anatomy-data}

hillhouse_nodes <- read_csv("data/hillhouse-nodes.csv")
hillhouse_nodes

hillhouse_edges <- read_csv("data/hillhouse-edges.csv")
hillhouse_edges

```
```{r}
ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = hillhouse_nodes, 
                edges = hillhouse_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ga

```


**Graph No3.**  
A different graph style - set graph _Via LAB07_  


```{r}

set_graph_style()

ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, colour = degree)) + 
  #facet_graph(type ~ race) +
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend") +
  labs(title = "Haunting of the hill house", subtitle = "Third graph", caption = "Ngl, I'm tired now..")

```




#### _During this workshop, it was a heck load of digital work but I'm not complaining though. This might have been the first time I've stared at my screen for so long but I did get to learn something. I wouldn't persoanlly want to take anything forward from this class in my future because I don't have any personal interests in coding or using a digital platform in general. But, I sure was intrigued by the level of learning and the amount of enthusiasm some of my classmates showed._
