<p>This workshop involved all of us learning to code using R. We made different kinds of graphs for different things. Here are some of the graphs we made:</p>
<div id="looking-at-baby-names-in-the-united-states" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking at baby names in the United States:</strong></h3>
<p>Here, we looked at different baby names and tried to see how many times they occured in a year. This graph analyses the names, Leslie, Lesley and Leslee:</p>

<div id="looking-at-the-sleep-patterns-of-animals" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking at the sleep patterns of animals:</strong></h3>
<p>In this graph, we looked at the sleep patterns of animals depending on their feeding type.</p>

<div id="looking-at-connections-between-characters-of-your-favorite-show" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Looking at connections between characters of your favorite show:</strong></h3>
<p>The graph below shows the different human relationships in the show, Rick &amp; Morty.</p>

<h3><strong>Reflections:</strong></h3>
<p>At first, coding may seem rather complex and blood-curdling. However, it isn’t really the case. I do admit, it’s got a small learning curve but it isn’t rocket science. The things achieved from a single line of code is quite mind-boggling! The fact that one can tell stories, identify data, plot maps and find relationships and networks using simple codes, makes the whole learning process worth it.</p>
<p>The graphs above are only a small fragment of what can be achieved. In two weeks, we’ve been able to learn a lot about coding, plotting graphs and even making maps!</p>
