## Graph 1.

```{r}
diamonds
```


```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = depth,
                 y = price,
                 color = cut),
             size = 0.4)
   ggtitle("Depth")
```


## Graph 2 


```{r}
bbox_bom <- getbb("Mumbai")

dat_b <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox_bom, key = "building")

dat_h <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox_bom, key = "highway")

dat_r <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_bom, key = "amenity", value = "restaurant", return_type = "point")

dat_r <- dat_r %>% drop_na(cuisine)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dat_b, fill = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = dat_h, color = "orange" ) +
  geom_sf(data = dat_r, color = "black", fill = "red", size = 1) +
  theme_dark() +
  labs(title = "Mumbai", subtitle = "Taste kahaan hai?")
```

## Graph 3 


```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Reflection 

I found the workshop a lot of fun. I have a bit of prior experience with coding, so it was quite interesting to get the hang of a new language. R is quite fun to use, it is also very intuitive. I never needed help with the syntax, since all the commands were easy to grasp and made sense. My experience with the class itself was pretty amazing. I've never had a teacher start the day with music sessions, it was honestly quite refreshing, especially early in the morning when I was still a bit sleepy. Also the recorded sessions were a blessing since i could immediately clarify any doubts I had.
