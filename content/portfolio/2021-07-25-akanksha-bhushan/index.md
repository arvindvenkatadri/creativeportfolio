## Instructions

Delete all of this and paste in your own content right here!!

### Portfolio File Format

To create a new Portfolio entry, make sure that you selected `R Markdown (.Rmd)` as the _format_ option of the post when using the `New Post` `blogdown` addin.

### Setup chunk

Make sure you edit the setup chunk above and bring in **all** packages you need using *r library(package_name)*. 


### Inserting a Custom image in your Post

The easiest option is to use the `blogdown` _Insert Image_ RStudio addin to add an external image.

Another way: use a code chunk, if you already have the image downloaded and ready. Place the image in the **same folder** as this Post, and link to it with the chunk below:

<img src="./default.jpg" width="100%" />

### Narrative Text and Futher Code chunks

Start typing/pasting text here.

Diamonds are forever. We can see that from this graph below:
