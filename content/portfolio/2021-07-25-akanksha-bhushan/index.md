## Graph 1

 For this map i took the star wars data set which had the variables name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, sex , gender, homeworld, species, films, vehicles and starships.

 My intent in this graph was to find out which all species have lived on the planet of Naboo.

## Graph 2

<<<<<<< .merge_file_a10424
In the first week we were also told to make a graph using a penguins dataset. The graph i'm showing below shows the flipper length in milli-meters of the male and female population.

The variables for this table are: Species, Island, Bill length in milli meters, Bill depth in millimeters, Flipper depth in millimeters, Body mass in grams, Sex and Year.

## Graph 3.

In this assignment we were told to make a csv file with our own dataset on a particular episode of a particular tv show, movie, book, etc. I chose the show Blood Of Zeus which is on Netflix as that was the last show i watched during the holidays. 

The graph bellow shows us the number of characters, the race of the characters and the weight of dialogues between the characters. The variables for this graph were Name, Sex, Race, Eye colour, Hair colour, Status and Dialogue weight.

This workshop really opened me up to the world of coding, I had a cycle before this that was based on a few coding software as well but it never came close to being this stressful whenever I got an error or when freeing when I got the result I wanted. 

Coming into the workshop I thought i would not like it as much because of the amount I complained in the previous cycle about coding but it actually turned out to be fun and having Arvind as a facilitator was a real plus point as he was patient enough to explain to my classmates and i where we were going wrong and also rectify our mistakes.
