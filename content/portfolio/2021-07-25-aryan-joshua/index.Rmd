## Introduction
Hi, I'm Aryan and here I have a few graphs on different topics that show my progress in being able to visualize data through various methods that I've learnt in this workshop.  


## Graph 1

I have chosen the diamond data set which contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54000 diamonds. The variety of attributes are the price of the diamond in US dollars, the carat of the diamond, the quality of the diamond (cut of the diamond), the colour and clarity and various dimensions of the diamonds.

```{r read-1}
glimpse(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
diamonds <- diamonds %>% drop_na()
```
Here I am trying to find a correlation between the depth and the x dimensions of a diamond. The depth of the diamond is total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43â€“79)

```{r plot-1}
diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(prop = 0.1) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = depth, y = x, color = color)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) + ggtitle("A Point Geom with Colour and Position Aesthetics") 

```


In this graph you can see that a lot of the diamonds are the same size even though they're different colours and have different depths. I have used a slice command to make the data set smaller as with the large amount of data, the graph would look very cluttered. I have plotted the depth on the x axis and the x dimensions of the diamond on the y axis with the color aesthetic being used to show the different colours of diamonds that exist.

## Graph 2

For this graph I have chosen to map out the cinemas located around Mysore. I have used data from OSM to locate the cinemas in Mysore. 

```{r prettymap, include=FALSE}
bbox_mysore <- prettymapr::searchbbox("Mysore, India") #For finding the spacial data on Mysore
```

```{r glimpse}
str(bbox_mysore)
glimpse(bbox_mysore)
```
After running the glimpse and str command, we can note the longitude and latitude of Mysore. It shows us the minimum and maximum longitude and latitude for the city. The minimum longitude is 76.49536 and maximum longitude is 76.81536 while the minimum latitude is 12.14518 and maximum latitude is 12.46518.


### Extracting data from OSM

Using Open Street Maps, I have extracted data regarding the buildings, highways and cinemas located in Mysore.
```{r bbox mysore}
bbox_mysore # to show min and max long lat.

# The extract osm objects is used to retrieve spacial data on various keys that are taken from Open Street Maps in the city that we specified. They can further be narrowed down to values which come under the keys are are more specific parts of the keys.

dat_mysore_B <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_mysore, key = "building")
dat_mysore_H <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_mysore, key = "highway")
dat_mysore_C <- extract_osm_objects(bbox_mysore, key = "amenity", value = "cinema", return_type = "point")

nrow(dat_mysore_H) #Shows us all the rows that data contains
nrow(dat_mysore_C)
```

### Map of Mysore Using ggplot

Using ggplot, I have created a map that includes the buildings, roads and mainly the cinemas that are located all around Mysore indicated by the yellow dots.


```{r tmap}
# Group 01 
tm_shape(dat_mysore_B) +
  tm_fill(col = "red") + 

# Group 02 
  tm_shape(dat_mysore_H) +
  tm_lines(col = "dodgerblue", lwd = 0.8) +
  
# Group 03
  tm_shape(dat_mysore_C) +
  tm_dots(size = 0.5, col = "orange", shape = 21) +
  tm_text("name", auto.placement = TRUE, size = 0.6) + 
  # for adding text tm_text("name", auto.placement = TRUE,)

# Group 04
   tm_compass(position = c("left", "top"),
             type = "rose",
             size = 2) + 
   tm_scale_bar(width = 5, position=c("left", "bottom"),
               text.size = 1) + 
# Group 05
    tm_layout(title = "Cinemas in Mysore", title.size = 1,  
              bg.color = "lightyellow", frame.lwd = 5) + 
    tm_credits(text = "Aryan Joshua, 2021",
             position = c("left", "bottom"))
 
```

## Graph 3

### The Simpsons Dataset

I have decided to use The Simpsons as the show I will be using for the networks created below. I have taken a list of characters and their connections with each other from Season 03 Episode 05. In the data set, the nodes contain the columns of their name, sex, occupation and hair colour. In the edges dataset, it contains the to and from, the weight and the amount of dialogues exchanged between the two characters in that particular episode.

```{r read-3}
#reading the data first
simpsons_nodes <- read_csv("./Data_Aryan/simpsons_database - nodes.csv")
simpsons_edges <- read_csv("./Data_Aryan/simpsons_database - edges.csv")
simpsons_nodes
simpsons_edges
```


###  Creating a Graph Object

```{r 2.Create-simpsons-graph-object}
ss <- tbl_graph(nodes = simpsons_nodes, 
                edges = simpsons_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ss
```

### VisNetwork Data
```{r simpsons-data-for-visnetwork}
library(visNetwork)

# Prepare the data for plotting by visNetwork
simpsons_nodes
simpsons_edges

simpsons_nodes_vis <- simpsons_nodes %>% 
  rename("label" = names) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("group" = `hair color`) 
simpsons_nodes_vis

simpsons_edges_vis <- simpsons_edges 

simpsons_edges_vis
```

### Interactive Network Based on Hair Colour of the Characters

I have plotted an interactive map that shows all the characters and how they're connected to each other in the particular Simpsons episode that I've chosen and also shows us the colour of their hair.

```{r simpsons-visNetwork}
simpsons_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = simpsons_edges_vis, background = "lightblue", main = "Hair Colour of all the Characters", submain = "The Simpsons") %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  
  # Colour and icons for each of the gender-groups
  visGroups(groupname = "None", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "grey"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Blue", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "blue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Blonde", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "yellow"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Purple", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "purple"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Black", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "black"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>%
            
  visGroups(groupname = "Brown", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "brown"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>%         
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Grey", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "dark grey"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "White", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "white"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  

  #Add the fontawesome icons!!
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  
  visLegend() %>%
  
  # Add Interaction Controls
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```


## My Course Reflection

This workshop was quite a different experience for me. I haven't done a lot of coding before this and trying to learn the syntax and various methods through which we could create these graphs was a bit taxing but with help from Arvind I was able to understand quite a bit of the information. The course was mainly about us being able to visualize data using R Studio. I found the theory of visualizing data intriguing and didn't know that there was a lot of thought also going into how and what data can be visualized. The pronouns opened an entirely new world for me in the way that I look at data now. I learnt the back-end process of making graphs through R Studio and also to think about what goes on the graphs and the design of the tables and graphs. I also learnt how to create my own data set which I am super proud of. This workshop also taught me how to analyse data and critique a graph to get the most information out of a graph. I was also really happy with the way Arvind taught us and was also super patient with us and didn't mind us asking him to explain the same code over and over again. I enjoyed this workshop quite a lot and I might go onto explore generative art through R Studio.

Thank You.
