## 3 of my favourite graphs

1.  Graph 1

    A graph of the American Indian population in the midwest USA.

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = poptotal, y = popamerindian)) + geom_point(colour = "red") + geom_smooth(colour = "yellow") 
```

2.  Graph 2


```{r osm}
bbox_l <- bbox <- osmplotr::get_bbox(c(77.56,12.93,77.63,12.96))
bbox_l
```

```{r data}
dat_B <- extract_osm_objects(key = "building", bbox = bbox_l) 
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects(key = 'highway', bbox = bbox_l)
dat_P <- extract_osm_objects(key = 'park', bbox = bbox_l)
dat_G <- extract_osm_objects(key = 'landuse', value = 'grass', bbox = bbox_l)
dat_T <- extract_osm_objects(key = 'natural', value = 'tree', bbox = bbox_l)
```


#### Bangalore map

This map visualises the highways, parks and trees around Bangalore, my hometown. The gray are the highways, orange the parks and purple are the trees.

```{r plot}

tm_shape(dat_B) + tm_polygons(col = "gray40") +
tm_shape(dat_G) + tm_fill(size = 4, col = "orange") +
tm_shape(dat_H) + tm_dots(col = "purple") +
tm_shape(dat_T) + tm_dots(col = "green") +

tm_layout(title = "Bangalore", title.size = 6, frame = TRUE, frame.lwd = 5, bg.color = "lightyellow")
```

### Network Graph

```{r read data, indlude = FALSE}
bojack_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/bojack-nodes.csv",trim_ws = TRUE) %>% 
  select(1:4) %>% 
  drop_na()
bojack_edges <- read_csv("./Data/bojack-edges.csv",trim_ws = TRUE)%>% 
  select(1:4) %>% 
  drop_na()
bojack_nodes
bojack_edges
```

3.  Graph 3

    This graph shows the connections/interactions between characters appearing in Season 1, Episode 12 of Bojack Horseman.

```{r}
bojack <- tbl_graph(nodes = bojack_nodes, 
                    edges = bojack_edges,
                    directed = FALSE)

ggraph(graph = bojack,  layout = "kk") +
geom_edge_link(width = 2, color = "black") +
geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8, fill = "pink", color = "red", stroke = 2) 
```

## Reflection

Learning this particular language of code was a different experience for me. I've had several encounters with code and they were always very stressful. This course was also stressful but one thing different is that I enjoyed learning and working with it.
