### REFLECTION

During this course, I learnt the importance of analysis of data. I realised that there are so many ways data can be represented, and doing it the right way makes the entire process of comprehension a whole lot easier. I also really liked playing around with maps and having fun with the datasets. Working with code to make these was a bit intimidating at first, but I did like that we were given time to play around and experiment with each module, to understand it better. After this workshop, I also feel like I am a lot more comfortable coding, and I think I understand programming better.
