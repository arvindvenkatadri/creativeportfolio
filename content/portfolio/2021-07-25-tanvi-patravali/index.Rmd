```{css, echo=FALSE}
body{color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:17px;font-family:Poppins;}
```



### ANALYSING MSLEEP DATA


###### _A bar graph showing the awake time of species, classified by order and eating habits_


```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(msleep) + geom_histogram(aes(x = awake, fill = order)) + facet_wrap(~vore)
```


<br>


###### _A density chart showing the total sleep time of different species, classifies by conservation status and thier eating habits_


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(msleep) + geom_density(aes(x = sleep_total, color = conservation, fill = conservation), alpha = 0.2) + facet_wrap(~vore)
```








### A NETWORK ANALYSIS FROM THE SERIES _THE GOOD DOCTOR_


###### _A network analysis between different characters from episode 3 and 4 of season 1_



```{r Read data, include=FALSE}
good_nodes <- read_delim(delim = ";", "./Data/good-doctor-nodes.csv" )
good_edges <- read_delim(delim = ";", "./Data/good-doctor-edges.csv")
good_nodes
good_edges
```


```{r Create-graph-object,include=FALSE}
gd <- tbl_graph(edges = good_edges, 
                nodes = good_nodes, 
                directed = FALSE)
gd
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggraph(graph = gd, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + 
  
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = role, size = 3)) +

  geom_node_label(aes(label = name), 
                  repel = TRUE, max.overlaps = 20,
                  alpha = 0.6,
                  size = 3) +
  
  labs(title = "A colourful Good Doctor graph")
```





### REFLECTION

During this course, I learnt the importance of analysis of data. I realised that there are so many ways data can be represented, and doing it the right way makes the entire process of comprehension a whole lot easier. I also really liked playing around with maps and having fun with the datasets. Working with code to make these was a bit intimidating at first, but I did like that we were given time to play around and experiment with each module, to understand it better. After this workshop, I also feel like I am a lot more comfortable coding, and I think I understand programming better.
